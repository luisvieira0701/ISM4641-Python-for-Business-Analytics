# ISM4641-Python-for-Business-Analytics
This is a repository containing my work in the course ISM4641. I am organizing weekly folders, each with assignments and projects. I am hoping to highlight my progress as I become proficient in Python focused for business analytics. For context, I have previous exp in Javascript (refer to other projects and scenarios from different repositories). 

Each week's file will have three main files:

1. Integrative Assignments - These are the projects I am working on weekly that will be graded
2. Practice Assignment - These are also weekly projects that serve as practice for the graded one. If not worked through, it means the main project took me a long time to complete
3. Gemini Chat History - Last but not least, the gemini chat history. Here you are able to see my thought process and how I am making projects more organized, functional, and efficient.
4. Others - The other files are likely slides or class notes I refer to when completing these projects.
