The investors from Apex Ventures are coming at 2 PM tomorrow, and our CEO, Marcus, needs solid numbers to present.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"I know it's your first day, but I've seen your coursework—you know Python, right? I need you to calculate our core business metrics. Nothing fancy, just accurate numbers that Marcus can trust. Can you help us?\"*\n",
