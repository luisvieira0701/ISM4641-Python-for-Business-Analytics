    "## 3.1 Introduction: From Calculations to Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 1, you learned Python's building blocks—variables, data types, and operators. With those tools, you could perform calculations, but your programs were **linear**: they executed one line after another, from top to bottom, without any decision-making capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real business problems require more sophistication:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A loan system** doesn't just calculate payments—it decides whether to approve or deny based on multiple factors\n",
    "- **An inventory system** doesn't just track quantities—it processes thousands of products and identifies which need reordering\n",
    "- **A customer analytics platform** doesn't analyze one customer—it segments millions into meaningful groups\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces two fundamental programming concepts that transform simple scripts into intelligent programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Control Flow**: The ability to make decisions and repeat actions\n",
    "2. **Data Structures**: Organized containers for storing and accessing collections of data\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Power of Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this business scenario: You need to determine shipping costs for 10,000 orders. The rules are:\n",
    "- Orders under $25: $5.99 shipping\n",
    "- Orders $25-$49.99: $3.99 shipping\n",
    "- Orders $50-$99.99: $1.99 shipping\n",
    "- Orders $100+: Free shipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Without programming, this would require:\n",
    "- Manual lookup of each order total\n",
    "- Decision about which tier applies\n",
    "- Entry of the shipping cost\n",
    "- **Estimated time: 40+ hours**\n",
    "\n",
    "With the concepts you'll learn today:\n",
    "- Write the logic once\n",
    "- Let Python process all 10,000 orders\n",
    "- **Actual time: Less than 1 second**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the transformative power of control flow and data structures."

    "1. **Write conditional statements** using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions in your programs\n",

    "5. **Control loop execution** using `break`, `continue`, and `else` clauses\n",
    "6. **Work with lists** to store, access, modify, and analyze ordered collections\n",
    "7. **Understand tuples** and when to use immutable sequences\n",
    "8. **Create and manipulate dictionaries** for key-value data storage\n",

    "### The Concept of Branching\n",
    "\n",
    "In everyday life, we constantly make decisions:\n",
    "- \"**If** it's raining, I'll take an umbrella\"\n",
    "- \"**If** the price is under $20, I'll buy it; **otherwise**, I'll wait for a sale\"\n",
    "- \"**If** my grade is A, I'm on the Dean's List; **else if** it's B, I'm doing well; **else**, I need to study more\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These are **conditional statements**—they execute different code based on whether conditions are true or false. In programming, we call this **branching** because the program's path can branch in different directions.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "|---------|---------|----------|\n",
